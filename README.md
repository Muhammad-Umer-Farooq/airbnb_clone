# Kanan's Airbnb Clone :house_with_garden:
## A clone of Airbnb.co.uk webpage using HTML and CSS only
### Created by Kanan Garayev

This is my project where I have replicated Airbnb webpage. I tried to make it look and feel like the original as much as practical. Given the time constraints, it is not perfect. Nevertheless, it looks impressive.

I have only used HTML and CSS to create this page, no programming has been used here. I have used this project to practice and showcase only my HTML and CSS knowledge and skills. 

I have progressively learnt both languages while I was working on this project. Hence, the way I have structured it is not perfect. Looking back, there are a number of things I could have done differently and more efficiently. Some of the opportunities for improvement are listed below. 

Nevertheless, this is my first custom-built webpage without the use of any frameworks such as Bootstrap. This project has allowed me to perfect my CSS skills and helped me gain confidence in using the language. Moreover, the speed of my use of these languages has improved significantly.

#### :sparkles: Main features:

* Use of CSS Flex
* Use of CSS Grid
* Use of Media Queries to create a fully responsive webpage
* Use of pseudo selectors
* Use of basic CSS animation


#### :zap: Opportunities for improvement:

* Better use of classes (i.e. better naming, and hence a more compact, efficient css code)
* Better use of inheritance selectors for a more compact code
* Use of CSS pre-processors (such as SASS)
* Better commenting
* Use of variables (could be combined together with the use of SASS)
