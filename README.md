# Kanan's Airbnb Clone
## A clone of Airbnb.co.uk webpage using HTML and CSS only

This is my personal project where I tried to replicate the look and feel of Airbnb webpage.
I have only used HTML and CSS to create this page, no programming has been employed here. I have used this project to practice and showcase my HTML and CSS knowledge and skills only. 

I have progressively learnt both languages and I went along. Hence, the code is far from perfect. Looking back, there are a number of things I could have done differently and more efficiently. Some of the opportunities for improvement are listed below. 

Nevertheless, this is my first custom-built webpage without the use of any frameworks such as Bootstrap. This project has allowed me to perfect my CSS skills and helped me gain confidence in using the language. Moreover, the speed of my use of these languages has improved significantly.

Things that could have been done better:
* Better use of classes (i.e. better naming, and hence a more compact, efficient css code)
* Better use of inheritance selectors for a more compact code
* Use of CSS pre-processors (such as SASS)
* Better commenting
* Use of variables (could be combined together with the use of SASS)
